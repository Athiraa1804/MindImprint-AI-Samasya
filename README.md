NeuroLens is an AI‑powered educational support system designed to understand how children learn—without labeling or diagnosing them. Rather than relying on clinical categories, NeuroLens focuses on observing behavioral patterns that naturally emerge when children engage in short, game‑based learning tasks.
These interactions allow the system to extract digital behavioral biomarkers related to attention regulation, impulsivity control, working memory, and executive functioning.

The core innovation of NeuroLens lies in its strength‑based cognitive profiling approach. Instead of producing a single score or label, the system generates a multidimensional learning profile that highlights both challenge areas and natural strengths. This profile helps educators and caregivers understand how a child engages with tasks, processes instructions, manages distractions, and responds under time pressure—information that is often missed in traditional assessments.
